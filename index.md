# INVITATION

You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether or not to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully.<br/><br/>


# GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESEARCH STUDY AND COLLECTED RESEARCH DATA

This research investigates the collaboration between musicians and machines, with the purpose of developing  software that will support musicians with an interest in music based on timbre to develop and expand their vocabulary.

This research will take place over four sessions, which will be facilitated by the Principal Investigator. During each session the conversation and the musical performance will be recorded. The conversations will be transcribed and anonymised, and the audio of the conversation will be destroyed.

If you give consent, anonymised quotes will be used as support in the dissemination of the findings.

If you give consent, excerpts of the musical performance will be used as audio support in the dissemination of the findings.

If you give consent, the musical performance will be used to train additional artificial intelligence models to produce more data within the context of this research.

If you give consent, the artificial intelligence models trained during the session will be used to generate additional audio to produce more data within the context of this research.

This research is funded by the Open University as part of the Principal Investigator's doctoral studies.

This research project has been reviewed by, and received a favourable opinion from, The Open University Human Research Ethics Committee – HREC reference number: 2024-0185-1.<br/><br/>


# WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO IF I AGREE TO TAKE PART? 

It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form. You will free to opt out up to one week after the last session.

When you agree to take part to the study, you will be asked to participate in four sessions where you will interact with an interactive music system. Ideally, the sessions should be one-week apart. If it that is not possible, the maximum distance between the first and the last session will be of two months, with each session at least one week apart from each other. The first session will be an hour and a half long, where the first half an hour will be used to introduce you to the study and to familiarise with the practicalities of the session. The subsequent three sessions will each be an hour long. 

The format of the study will be of a short course, where the interactive music system will take, to some extent, the role of a teacher. During the session, you will be asked to play short phrases for which the main attribute will be timbre, as opposed to pitch. We will be looking at what kind of support the system can provide you with in expanding the vocabulary of a set of sounds you want to explore. Optionally, you can provide any further comment or thought in between sessions, written or as a voice note, and up to one week after the last session.

The outcome of this study will provide us with new knowledge about how we can improve music interactive systems for musical practices that are oriented to timbre. Also, we may be able to gain more understanding on how timbre is used and interpreted in musical practices where pitch is not the most relevant attribute.<br/><br/>


# HOW WILL THE DATA I PROVIDE BE USED?

The collected data will be stored on a computer protected by a password, and backup copies will be stored on Microsoft OneDrive and on an encrypted external hard drive. Once the findings are written up, your anonymised data will be transferred to the Open Research Data Online (ORDO), which is The Open University's research data repository, and stored for at least 10 years. The data you will give consent for will be made publicly accessible on ORDO for at least 10 years. No personal data will be transferred to ORDO.

The audio recordings of the conversations will be transcribed and anonymised. The audio will be destroyed after they have been transcribed. Optional voice notes that you provide will be transcribed and anonymised. The audio will be destroyed after the transcription. Optional written notes will be transcribed and anonymised. The original written notes will be destroyed after they have been transcribed.

The signed consent forms will be digitalised and retained by the Open University beyond the course of the project.

The research findings will be submitted as research papers for conferences and/or scientific journals, along with being included in the Principal Investigator’s PhD thesis. Quotes and information about the extracts of the music performance will be anonymised. <br/><br/>


# YOUR RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY

You have the right to withdraw from the study and ask for your data to be removed by sending an email to the Principal Investigator up until one week after the last of the four sessions has taken place. <br/><br/>
